boothedog.html

img class needed an < to get the image to display

On the list of favorite things the writer forgot to put <li> on the ends to indicate list.

A few formatting issues on the html I edited that weren't functional but made it easier to read.


<script type="text/javascript" src="errors.js"></script> was changed to <script type="text/javascript" src="logic.js"></script>

Changed buttons to match color by changing id tags in html

logic.js

#changed pink to "pink"
$("#textPink").on("click", function() {
	$("#funText").css("color", "pink")
})


Added quotations around the "click" on the grow shrink commands.

Changed var booFacts to booFactsArray and separated list items with quotes.


style.css

Font size needs to be bigger for title so I changed to <h1> tags
